- Update workflow history and analytics
- Notify stakeholders of completion

## EXECUTION PATTERNS:

### Sequential Execution:
```
Agent A → Agent B → Agent C → Result
```
- Linear workflow with dependencies
- Each agent waits for previous completion
- State passed sequentially between agents

### Parallel Execution:
```
     ┌─ Agent B ─┐
Agent A         ├─ Aggregator → Result
     └─ Agent C ─┘
```
- Independent tasks executed concurrently
- Results aggregated at synchronization points
- Optimal resource utilization

### Conditional Execution:
```
Agent A → Decision → Agent B (if condition)
                  └→ Agent C (else)
```
- Dynamic workflow routing based on conditions
- Real-time decision making and branching
- Context-aware execution paths

### Hierarchical Execution:
```
Master Agent
├─ Sub-workflow A (Agent B, Agent C)
└─ Sub-workflow B (Agent D, Agent E)
```
- Nested workflows with sub-orchestration
- Hierarchical task decomposition
- Scalable execution architecture
